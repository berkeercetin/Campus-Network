# Campus-Network!
This project is a Cisco Packet Tracer project created within the scope of an internship at Ä°zmir Metropolitan Municipality (IZBB) to learn Cisco networking.

## Abstract
The project is designed to simulate a campus network. It focuses on three faculty buildings, one server building, an externally accessible network, and data reception from an external server.

## Acquirements

The acquirements of the project are as follows:

- Assigning different VLANs to users in different roles and in different buildings.
- Establishing the logic of routing and switching between large structures.
- Configuring DHCP IP pools based on roles and VLANs.
- Implementing redundancy for critical nodes such as the main router.
- Creating a public wireless network for the organization and configuring the necessary permissions on this network using Access Control Lists (ACLs).
